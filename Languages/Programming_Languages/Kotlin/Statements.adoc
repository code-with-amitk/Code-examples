== switch = when
writing many if..else expressions, you can use the when expression
```kt
fun main() {
  val day = 4
  
  val result = when (day) {
    1 -> "Monday"
    2 -> "Tuesday"
    3 -> "Wednesday"
    4 -> "Thursday"
    5 -> "Friday"
    6 -> "Saturday"
    7 -> "Sunday"
    else -> "Invalid day."
  }
  println(result)    //Thursday
}
```
