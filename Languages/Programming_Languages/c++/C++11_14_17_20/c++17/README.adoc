== ABOUT ASSEMBLY
```c
1. Stack grows in reverse direction.
  |----stack grows-----|-------------><------heap grows------
 0x450                0x200
 rbp                  rsp       

2. rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9: Stores 1st 6 arguments to function. If there are more than 6 parameters, 
   then the program’s stack is used to pass in additional parameters to the function.

3. rax: stores return value of the function. Larger return types like structs are returned using the stack.

4. rax, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, rsp, r8-r11: These are caller save registers. 
   rbx, rbp, r12-r15: These are callee save registers. These are saved across function calls.   	
   |- As per telephone system. Caller is main(), callee fun()
```
