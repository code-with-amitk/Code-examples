## Smart Pointers
Same as [C++ Smart,shared pointers](/Languages/Programming_Languages/c++/pointers), allocates memory and deallocates when all references to it goes out of scope. References are also smart pointers but they only point to 1 value. Examples: `vec<T>`, String.
- Smart pointers are implemented using structs.
- To dereference the smart pointer(ie get content of memory pointed by smart pointer), smart pointer class should define deref() function from **[Deref trait](#w)**

## Implementing own Smart pointer
<a name=wo></a>
### SP Without dereference operator
That means memory is allocated, smart pointer points to it but we cannot dereference(ie access contents).
```rs
//struct Test(a);       //This struct can accept type=a, hence not generic.
struct Test<T>(T);      //This is generic, since T can be any type

impl <T> Test<T> {          //This is how to define generic
   fn new(x:T) -> Test<T> { //new() takes generic and returns structure object containing x
       Test(x)
   } 
}

fn main () {
  let mut y = Test::new(5);
  //println("{}",*y);               //Compilation Error
}  
```

### SP with dereference operator / deref trait
- if any structure want to implement a trait, that structure need to provide implementations for the traitâ€™s required methods. 
- For dereference opeartor to become available, deref() function of Deref trait(provided by standard library), need to be implemented.
```rs
use std::ops::Deref;

struct Test<T>(T);

//if we try to place new() inside Deref trait, complier will give error since no function named new() is not declared in 
// Standard library provided Deref trait.

impl<T> Deref for Test<T> {                     //Standard Library's deref trait
    type Target = T;                            //type is associated Type to be used inside Deref trait.
    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {          //Defining deref()
        &self.0                                 //return value from structure which dereference want to get
    }
}

impl<T> Test<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> Test<T> {                  //impl providing new() function.
        Test(x)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let y = Test::new(5);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);          //Now derefrence smart pointer will work
}

$ cargo run
5
```

## Drop Triat(Running Code on Cleanup with the Drop Trait) = Destructor
Call drop() function when a value is about to go out of scope. We can provide code to release resources like files or network connections when SP goes out of scope.
### Implementing Drop Triat
The Drop trait requires to implement 1 method `drop()` that takes a mutable reference to self.
```rs
struct mySmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for mySmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {              
        println!("Dropping mySmartPointer, data: `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
  {
    let c = mySmartPointer {
        data: String::from("my stuff"),
    };
    let d = mySmartPointer {
        data: String::from("other stuff"),
    };
    println!("mySmartPointer created.");
  } //Drop triat is called, since SP goes out of scope
}
$ cargo run
mySmartPointer created
Dropping mySmartPointer, data: my stuff
Dropping mySmartPointer, data: other stuff
```
### Dropping value inside smart pointer early = Calling Destructor Explicitly
We need to call `std::mem::drop()`, this calls destructor.
```rs
struct mySmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for mySmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping mySmartPointer `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
  {
    let c = mySmartPointer {
        data: String::from("some data"),
    };
    println!("mySmartPointer created");
    drop(c);
    println!("mySmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
  }
}
$ cargo run
mySmartPointer created
Dropping mySmartPointer some data               //Drop triat called early without being waiting to go out of scope.
mySmartPointer dropped before the end of main.
```

## Most Common Smart Pointers
<a name=box></a>
### `Box<T>`
This is smart pointer allocated on heap and variable to store pointer lies on stack.
```rs
fn main() {
    let y = Box::new(5);    //5 is allocated on heap. y points to 5 stored on stack.
    println ("{}", *y);     //5
}   //box deallocated here
```
