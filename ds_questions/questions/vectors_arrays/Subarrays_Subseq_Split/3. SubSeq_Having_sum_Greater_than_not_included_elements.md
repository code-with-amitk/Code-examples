### [Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-183/problems/minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order/)
- Find minimum subsequence from array, whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence. 
- Examples
```c++
Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
Output: [10,9]   
//The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, 
however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.

Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
Output: [7,7,6]
//The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). 
Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.

Input: nums = [6]
Output: [6]
```

### Logic
1. sort 10,9,8,4,3
2. find sum = 34           //O(n)
3. Find sum from start, sum from end. Break when sum-from-start >= sum-from-end
```c++
 array  10 9 8 4 3
 index  0  1 2 3 4

 i  sum-from-start(sfs)   sum-from-end(sfe)
      
 0    10                  9+8+4+3 = 34 - 10 = 24
 1    10+9=19             8+4+3   = 24 - 9  = 15
 2    10+9+8=27           4+3     = 15 - 8  = 7
 Break when sof>=soe. This will break at 19
```

### Code
```c++
#include<iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
        vector<int> minSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {
                vector<int> v;
                int s1=0, sfs=0,sfe=0;

                sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());

                for(auto i:nums){
                        s1 += i;
                }

                sfe = s1;

                for(auto i:nums){
                        if(sfe>=sfs){
                                sfs = sfs + i;
                                sfe = sfe - i;
                                v.push_back(i);
                        }
                        if(sfe<sfs)
                                break;
                }
                return v;
        }
};

int main(){
        Solution s;
        vector<int> nums = {4,3,10,9,8};      //Output: 10,9
//      vector<int> nums = {4,4,7,6,7};       //Output: 7,7,6
//      vector<int> nums = {6};               //Output: 6
        vector<int> v = s.minSubsequence(nums);
        for(auto i:v){
                cout<<i<<" ";
        }
}
```
