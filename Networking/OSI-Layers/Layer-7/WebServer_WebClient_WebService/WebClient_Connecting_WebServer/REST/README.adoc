== REST API / Representation State Transfer
* *Restful Web Server/Application?* Web application that implements link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/README.md#mea[HTTP CRUD methods] in Restful way. Eg: Twitter, facebook are implemented using restful APIs.
* When web-client calls Restful APIs then Web-Server can return link:/Languages/ScriptingLanguages/JavaScript[JSON] or HTML or link:/Languages/Markup_Language[XML]

=== REST API
Same as link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/README.adoc[HTTP CRUD methods]

=== How REST Works?
```c
1. Web server(abc.com) defines Resources(Eg: Customers, movies, cars etc) and exposes a service/End point eg:(https://abc.com/api/movies), where
   abc.com  : Domain
   api      : Convention(mostly used by companies) to expose RESTful services
   movies   : Resource 
2. Web client will use above END POINT(https://abc.com/api/movies) to talk to Web service to perform CRUD Operations on Resource
3. Perform CRUD Operations on Resource.   

   Web Client                                         Web Service
   GET www.abc.com/api/movies HTTP/1.1       --------->           Query list of movies
                           <-[ {id:1,'movie1'}, {id:2,'movie2'} ]-

   GET www.abc.com/api/movies/1 HTTP/1.1    --------->         return id=1 movie
                                       <-[ {id:1,'movie1'} ]-
   
   POST www.abc.com/api/movies {id:3, 'movie3'} HTTP/1.1  --------->  Add object [ {id:1,'movie1'}, {id:2,'movie2'}, {id:3,'movie3'} ]
   PUT www.abc.com/api/movies/1 {id:1, 'movie11'} HTTP/1.1 ---------> Updates db [ {id:1,'movie11'}, {id:2,'movie2'}, {id:3,'movie3'} ]
   DELETE www.abc.com/api/movies/1 HTTP/1.1             ---------> Delete object [ {id:2,'movie2'}, {id:3,'movie3'} ]
                        

   Client	                        	                Web Service
 http://<ip-address>/api/resource-name
                                          Implement APIs GET(){..} POST(){..} PUT(){..} DELETE(){..}
                     <---data----
```
* *Why Restful?*
- *1. Rest makes Web Service OS Independent:* Web applications can reside on different operating systems, some could be on Windows, and others could be on Linux.
- *2. Rest makes Web Service language independent:* Web services can be implemented in any language(C++,RUST etc)
- *3. On Cloud:* RESTful applications are moved can reside on cloud. Azure and Amazon provide a lot of API's based on the Restful architecture. 

=== Restful Methods/APIs/Verbs
Web Client call these [HTTP CRUD methods](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/README.md#mea) and response returned over HTTP.
```c
  - POST: This will create a new record in web service
  - GET: Get list of all records in web service
  - PUT: Update a record in web service
  - DELETE: delete 1 record in web service
  - PATCH: If we want to update only 1 field of object.
```

== Comparisons
=== REST vs [HTTP](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/)
|===
||REST|HTTP

|What|Set of rules|L7 protocol
|Focus|Resource|Methods to get
|===

=== REST vs SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)
|===
||REST|SOAP

|Why|To access web service|Same
|Flexible|More|Less, hard to use
|Relies on|JSON,XML,CSV,RSS|XML, CORBA(Common Object Request Broker Architecture) rely on binary messaging
|Advgs over soap|small learning curve, smaller messages
|===

=== REST vs gRPC
|===
||REST|gRPC(Remote Procedure Call)

|What|Method to implement API|same
|size,speed|less(uses json)|Better. Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its interface definition language. This binary serialization format is more efficient in terms of size and speed
|Communication|1 direction|Bidirectional. both the client and server to send a stream of messages
|Efficiency|HTTP/1.1|More. uses HTTP/2 for transport
|===

=== Constraints for RESTFUL application
- **a. Uniform interface:**
  - client request must include a resource identifier. The response the server returns include enough information so the client can modify the resource.
- **b. Client - server separation:** 
  - The client and the server act independently, each on its own, and the interaction between them is only in the form of requests, initiated by the client only.
- **c. Stateless:** Server does not store information about client who uses the APIs.
- **d. Layered system:** 
  - Between the client who requests a representation of a resourceâ€™s state, and the server who sends the response back, there might be a number of servers in the middle.These servers might provide a security, caching, load-balancing layers or other functionality. 
- **e. Cacheable:** 
  - Data sent by server contains information about whether or not the data is cacheable. If the data is cacheable, it might contain sort of a version number. Since the client knows which version of the data it has the client can avoid requesting the same data again.
- **f. Code-on-demand(optional):** 
  - The client can request code from the server, and then the response from the server will contain some code, usually in the form of a script. The client then can execute that code.
