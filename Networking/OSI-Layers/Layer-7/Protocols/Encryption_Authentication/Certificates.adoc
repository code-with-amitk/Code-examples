=== Advantages
* _1._ More secure wrt link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-3/Security/AAA_Authentication_Authorization_Accounting/Authentication/Type_Of_Authentication/[Pre shared keys]
* _2._ More ideal in larger scale environments with numerous peer sites that should not all share a preshared key.
* _3._ Certificate Revocation status can be checked, which's not the case with Pre shared keys.
* _4._ Certificates are not easily vulnerable to visual eavesdropping.

=== Disadvantages
* _1._ certificates can be compromised if access to filesystem on which they are stored is obtained.
* _2._ Complex process wrt psk.
* _3._ Takes more resources wrt psk.

=== Certificate Example
```c
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)                                                            //Version of X.509 standard
        Serial Number: 3 (0x3)    
        Signature Algorithm: sha512WithRSAEncryption     //Digital Signature Algorithm. Algo used by CA to sign cert
        Issuer:                                                                         //CA that Issued the Certificate
            C=ZA,         //country
