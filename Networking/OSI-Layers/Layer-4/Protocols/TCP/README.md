## TCP / Transmission Control Protocol
- **Why?** Port to Port/Process to process delivery, Congestion & flow Control, Error detection.
- *[TCP_Header](TCP_Header)*
- *[Characteristics](TCP_Characteristics):* Reliable, Connection Oriented, Error Detection & Recovery, Flow control, QOS, Full Duplex
- [State Transition Diagram](State_Transition_Diagram):
  - 3 Way Handshake: Why ISN is random in SYN?
  - Connection Tear Down Process
- [TCP Delay Control Timers](Delay_Control_Timers): RTO(Retransmission timeout), Persistent timer, Keep alive timeout, Time wait timer
- [Advantages, Disadvantages of TCP](Advantages_Disadv_of_TCP)
