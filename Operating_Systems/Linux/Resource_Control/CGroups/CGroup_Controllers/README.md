## Cgroup Controllers / Resource Controllers
- **What?** These controllers are mounted automatically by systemd. These are listed in `/proc/cgroups`.
- **Available Resource Controllers?**
  - blkio: sets limits on input/output access to and from block devices;
  - cpu: uses the CPU scheduler to provide cgroup tasks access to the CPU. It is mounted together with the cpuacct controller on the same mount;
  - cpuacct: creates automatic reports on CPU resources used by tasks in a cgroup. It is mounted together with the cpu controller on the same mount;
  - cpuset: assigns individual CPUs (on a multicore system) and memory nodes to tasks in a cgroup;
  - devices: allows or denies access to devices for tasks in a cgroup;
  - freezer: suspends or resumes tasks in a cgroup;
  - memory: sets limits on memory use by tasks in a cgroup and generates automatic reports on memory resources used by those tasks;
  - net_cls: tags network packets with a class identifier (classid) that allows the Linux traffic controller (the tc command) to identify packets originating from a particular cgroup task. A subsystem of net_cls, the net_filter (iptables) can also use this tag to perform actions on such packets. The net_filter tags network sockets with a firewall identifier (fwid) that allows the Linux firewall (the iptables command) to identify packets (skb->sk) originating from a particular cgroup task;
  - perf_event: enables monitoring cgroups with the perf tool;
  - hugetlb: allows to use virtual memory pages of large sizes and to enforce resource limits on these pages.
