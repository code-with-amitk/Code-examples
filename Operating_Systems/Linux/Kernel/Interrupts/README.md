## Interrupt
- **What?** 
  - Interrupt is event generated by hardware(I/O Device) which is sent to CPU by Interrupt Controller. CPU is asked to perform some high priority task wrt what its doing. Information from interrupt(eg: key pressed) is converted to character and stored in buffer to be later used by ISR. 
- [Type and Sources of Interrupts](Types_And_Sources_of_Interrupts)
- **Example of Hardware Interrupt:**  
  - User is watching a movie and presses key on keyboard(hardware device). Hardware device/Periheral generates H/W Interrupt sends to [Interrupt Controller-8952 on IR0-IR7 lines](/Motherboard/8952_PIC). IC decides priority of Interrupt and forwards to CPU on [CPU's INTR(Interrupt) PIN](/Motherboard/CPU/8086/PIN_Diagram.md).
  - CPU stops what it is doing and [Saves state](Things_CPU_does_after_getting_Interrupt.md).
  - Finds [ISR(Interrupt Service Routine/Interrupt Handler)](ISR_Interrupt_Service_Routine.md) from [IVT(Interrupt Vector Table)](IVT_Interrupt_Vector_Table.md), executes ISR. After completing the ISR resumes the task what it was doing.

- **Interrupt Numbers?** 256 types of Interrupts(0-255). Examples: 0: Pointer Divide Error    1: Pointer single Step    2: Pointer Non-maskable    3: Pointer I-Byte NIT Instruction    4: Pointer Overflow    5-31: Reserved for future use
- All reported Interrupts are shown in [/proc/interrupts and /proc/stat](Interrupts_Information.md).
