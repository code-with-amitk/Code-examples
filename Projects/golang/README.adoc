== Daemon
* main should relaunch itself in background once main exits
* daemon process should read cpu, gpu usage and log the same in 
```c
linux = /tmp/gpu_usage.txt and /tmp/cpu_usage.txt
windows = c:/temp/gpu_usage.txt and c:/temp/cpu_usage.txt
```
* This should work seemlessly on cross platform on windows and linux.
