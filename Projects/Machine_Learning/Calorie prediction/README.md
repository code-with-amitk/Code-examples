## Requirement
- We are running a company which need to predict calories needed by atheletes based on duration, pulse, maxpulse rates of their workouts
- We need a ML model which takes (Duration,Pulse,Maxpulse,Calories) as input and predicts Calories burned during athlete workout.

## How it Works
- We will write Decision Tree Regressor(Supervised Learning Machine Learning Model) & Random Forest Regressor(Supervised Learning Machine Learning Model)
which takes (Duration, Pulse, MaxPulse) as input and predict Calories burned by athelete and them compare Mean Absolute Error of both models
