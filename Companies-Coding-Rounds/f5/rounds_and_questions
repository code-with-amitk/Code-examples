Round-1(Coding Hackerrank): 3 questions
  
Round-2(Technical): Everything about TCP
  1. Is TCP connection established between end to end or hop to hop?
  2. Congestion Control, Flow Control
  3. Slding window
 
Round-3(Technical): Again on TCP
  1. Exponential backoff Algo
  2. Nagle Algo
  3. What is SACK, why its used?
  4. Data structure of a trie node?
  
Round-4(Technical-Manager)
  1. reverse words of string.
      "today is friday" should become "friday is today"
      - How we are going to test this rigoursly covering all test cases.
  2. Do you know SAML, we work lot on it.
  
Round-5(Techincal Hackerrank test):
 1. memcpy vs memmove
 2. HTTP
  - which http request is used to partially modify a resource
  - which HTTP response code shows attempt to access restricted resource
  - what return code is returned after successful HTTP DELETE
  - What are all READ ONLY methods in REST 
 3. delete[] vs delete

Round-6(Technical):
 1. volatile variable?
 2. const volatile?
 3. remove word(world) from string using strstr	"hello world there"
 4. switching bit on or off 
 5. how ping works?
 6. ARP cache?
 8. how agile works?
 9. Phony targets in Makefile

Round-7(Technical):
1. What's output of this?

#define A B(HOST, "HOST"), B(CONTENT, "cont")

#define B(suf, ...) HTTP_ ## suf

enum C{
  A
};
# undef B

2. struct A{
  int a;
  char b[12];
};
  A obj;
both are correct but which should be used?
  a. memset(&obj, 0, sizeof(struct A))
  b. memset(&obj, 0, sizeof(obj))       <<<<<<<<This should be used
