== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/description/[1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest]
Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

```c
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
Output: [[1,2,4]]
```

== Approach

=== Logic
* Take nodes to be deleted in hashset
* perform a Postorder Traversal, pass bIsRoot flag indicating whether the current node is a root of a tree in the forest. 
* Recursively call dfs for the left and right children of the current node. Pass parameter for the children is set based on whether the current node is marked for deletion
* If the current node is not marked for deletion and is a potential new root (flag), add it to the result vector res.
* If the current node is marked for deletion, set the current node to nullptr to delete it from the tree.

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
    void dfs(TreeNode* &root, bool bIsRoot, vector<TreeNode*>& out, unordered_set<int>& usNodesToBeDeleted){
        if (root == nullptr) 
            return;
        
        bool bDelNode = false;
        if (usNodesToBeDeleted.find(root->val) != usNodesToBeDeleted.end())
            bDelNode = true;

        dfs(root->left, bDelNode, out, usNodesToBeDeleted);
        dfs(root->right, bDelNode, out, usNodesToBeDeleted);

        // If the current node is not marked for deletion (!bDelNode) 
        // and is a new root (bIsRoot), add it to the result vector out
        if (!bDelNode && bIsRoot) out.push_back(root);

        // If the current node is marked for deletion
        // set the current node to nullptr to delete it from the tree.
        if (bDelNode) root = nullptr;
    }
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        unordered_set<int> usNodesToBeDeleted;
        vector<TreeNode*> out;
        for (int i : to_delete)
            usNodesToBeDeleted.insert(i);
        dfs(root, true, out, usNodesToBeDeleted);
        return out;
    }
};
```
