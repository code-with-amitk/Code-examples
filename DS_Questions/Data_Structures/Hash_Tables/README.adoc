* What is Hash Table
* Internal implementation of Hash Table
* Hash Collision
  * Solutions: Open Addressing(Types: Linear/Sequential probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing), Seperate Chaining
* Rehashing
* Implementations(2-left hashing, d-left hashing)

== HT vs Self Balanced BT
```c
                                                         Hash-Tables            |        Self-Balancing BT
---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------
Complexity(Insert/Delete/Search) | O(1)[Average Time], O(n) during table resize | O(log n)[guaranteed all times].
Collision                        | Yes                                          | never
Implementation                   | Tough, We depend on libraries                | Easy, we can implement our own customized BST
ADVANTAGES of Tree over HT       |                                              | 1. Data can be retrieved in sorted order. inorder-traversal: O(n)
                                                                                | 2. lowest, biggest element finding: easy
                                                                                | 3. No need to guess size of input data.
