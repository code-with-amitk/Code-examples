== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-stack-with-increment-operation[1381. Design a Stack With Increment Operation]
Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

Implement the CustomStack class:

CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.
int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.
 
```c
Example 1:
Input
["CustomStack","push","push","pop","push","push","push","increment","increment","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
[[3],[1],[2],[],[2],[3],[4],[5,100],[2,100],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,103,202,201,-1]
Explanation
CustomStack stk = new CustomStack(3); // Stack is Empty []
stk.push(1);                          // stack becomes [1]
stk.push(2);                          // stack becomes [1, 2]
stk.pop();                            // return 2 --> Return top of the stack 2, stack becomes [1]
stk.push(2);                          // stack becomes [1, 2]
stk.push(3);                          // stack becomes [1, 2, 3]
stk.push(4);                          // stack still [1, 2, 3], Do not add another elements as size is 4
stk.increment(5, 100);                // stack becomes [101, 102, 103]
stk.increment(2, 100);                // stack becomes [201, 202, 103]
stk.pop();                            // return 103 --> Return top of the stack 103, stack becomes [201, 202]
stk.pop();                            // return 202 --> Return top of the stack 202, stack becomes [201]
stk.pop();                            // return 201 --> Return top of the stack 201, stack becomes []
stk.pop();                            // return -1 --> Stack is empty return -1.
```

== Approach (using vector)
=== Logic
* Take vector to mimic stack
* Take top and maxSize to track size and resizing of stack.

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class CustomStack {
    std::vector<int> s;
    int top;
    int maxSize;
public:
    CustomStack(int m) {
        s.resize(m);
        top = 0;
        maxSize = m;
    }
    void push(int x) {
        if (top < maxSize)
            s[top++] = x;
    }
    int pop() {
        int ret = -1;
        if (top > 0) { // Check if there are elements to pop
            ret = s[--top]; // Decrement top first then access
        }
        return ret;
    }
    void increment(int k, int val) {
        int limit = std::min(k, top); // Ensure we don't exceed current stack size
        for (int i = 0; i < limit; ++i) {
            s[i] += val; // Increment only up to the limit
        }
    }
};

/**
 * Your CustomStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * CustomStack* obj = new CustomStack(maxSize);
 * obj->push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
 * obj->increment(k,val);
 */
```
