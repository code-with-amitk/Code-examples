There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.
```c
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
```

== Approach-1. Count
=== Logic
* We donot need to copy all characters on notepad all times.
```c
Number of characters needed on notepad: 5
Operation Characters on notepad  Steps
 Copy         A                   1
 paste        AA                  2
 paste        AAA                 3    //if we have copied(AA), then we never had reached 5
 paste        AAAA                4
 paste        AAAAA               5

Number of characters needed on notepad: 6
Operation Characters on notepad  Steps
 Copy         A                   1
 paste        AA                  2
 copy         AA                  3
 paste        AAAA                4
 paste        AAAAAA              5
 paste        AAAAA               5
```
* At each step, we need to check whether we can reach(desired no of characters using copy of present chars on notepad) or we donot need copy
```c
if ((number of still chars needed) % (chars on notepad presently) == 0)
  We can copy and paste characters
else
  We cannot copy just paste the characters copied earlier
```
=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(1)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
        int charCountOnNotepad = 1;		// Number of characters present on notepad
        int charsInCopiedBuffer = 0;	// Number of characters present in buffer after Cntl^C
        int steps = 0;
        while (charCountOnNotepad < n){		// Iterate until we have n characters on notepad
			  int neededCharsOnNotepad = n - charCountOnNotepad;
            if (neededCharsOnNotepad % charCountOnNotepad == 0) {
        				/*
        					Condition-1: Needed characters are multiple of character on notepad,
                               We can copy all characters and paste all
        				               steps = 2 (copy, paste)	
        				*/
                charsInCopiedBuffer = charCountOnNotepad;
                charCountOnNotepad += charCountOnNotepad;
                steps += 2;
            }else if (charsInCopiedBuffer!=0 && (neededCharsOnNotepad % charsInCopiedBuffer == 0)){
        				/*
        					Condition-2: Needed characters are not multiple of character on notepad,
                               We cannot copy all characters on notepad, only option is
        								       Just paste chars copied earlier
                               Steps=1 (paste)
        				*/
                charCountOnNotepad += charsInCopiedBuffer;
                steps++;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```
