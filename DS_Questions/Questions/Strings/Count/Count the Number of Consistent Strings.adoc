== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-consistent-strings/[1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings]
You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.
```c
Example 1:
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

Example 2:
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.

Example 3:
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
```

== Approach. O(mn)
=== Logic
* Insert all characters of string allowed into unordered_set
* count the number of output strings into int count.
* Iterate over all word from vector<words>. 
** Iterate over all characters of word
** if any character is not found in allowed unordered_set. Donot increment the count.

=== Complexity
* Time: O(mn). m=Number of strings in words. n=Length of max word
* Space: O(x). x=Length of allowed string

=== Code
==== CPP11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countConsistentStrings(string allowed, vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_set<char> usAllowed, usWords;
        for (auto&i:allowed) {
            auto it = usAllowed.find(i);
            if (it == usAllowed.end())
                usAllowed.insert(i);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for_each (words.begin(), words.end(), [usAllowed, &count](string& word){
            bool bConsistent = true;
            // Iterate all elements of word, if any character not found continue to next word
            for(auto&i:word) {
                if (usAllowed.find(i) == usAllowed.end()) {
                    bConsistent = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (bConsistent)
                count++;
        });
        return count;
    }
};
