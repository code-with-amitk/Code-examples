== Proxy
* This is a server to which requests(http(web traffic) or ip) can be sent instead of origin server.
* For example User types in "google.com", instead of sending http request to google server, We send request to proxy server.

=== Types of Proxy
==== 1. Forward/Web/Server Proxy
Node sitting in front of client machines. When user computer make requests to sites/services on Internet, the proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with web servers on behalf of clients.
```c
    User-Computer-1 ------>
    User-Computer-2 ------>  Forward-Proxy            internet            Destination-server(www.test.com)
    User-Computer-3 ------>
```  
===== Why Forward Proxy needed
* *a.* User Restrictions: Some schools/companies use firewalls to give limited access to Internet(eg: blocked for some sites). 
* *b.* To protect their identity online: In some cases, users want increased anonymity online.

==== 2. Reverse Proxy 
Node sitting in front of 1 or more web servers. User requests will reach Reverse proxy. RP will query WS and send response to users.
```c
    User-Computer-1 --->                                                                        Origin/Web-Server-1
                                                     internet                Reverse-Proxy      Origin/Web-Server-2
    User-Computer-2 --->                                                                        Origin/Web-Server-3
```
===== Why reverse Proxy needed?
* *a. Load Balancing:* A website receiving millions of connections need to distribute load among different backend servers, reverse proxy can provide a load balancing solution
* *b. Attack Protection:* Origin server's IP addresses are not exposed to attackers, making it difficult to intrude. Eg: DDOS attacks
* *c. Caching:* RP can cache data, resulting in faster performance.
* *d. SSL Encryption:* encryption/decryption is expensive at origin server. RP can be configured to decrypt all incoming and encrypt all outgoing responses, freeing up valuable resources on the origin server.

==== 3. Explicit Proxy
* Client Browser is explicitly configured to use a proxy server, meaning the browser knows that all requests will go through a proxy. 
* Browser can be configured to use link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/Terms.adoc[PAC file], which again uses explicit proxy.
* The disadvantage to explicit proxy is that each desktop must be properly configured to use the proxy, which might not be feasible in a large organization.

==== 4. Transparent Proxy
* Client Browser does not know the traffic is being processed by a proxy other than the origin server.
* To enable the Transparent Proxy we must create a service and define it as transparent. The service is configured to intercept traffic for a specified port, or for all IP addresses on that port.
