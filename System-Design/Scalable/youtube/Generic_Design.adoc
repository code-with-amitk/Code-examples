=== Requirements

==== Functional
* Video: Upload, Watch, search, Comment, like, dislike, share
* Channel: Can create, Statistics(Views, comments etc)
* Subscribe, Support ads, Live Stream

==== Non-Functional
* Fast: Video upload, watching should be fast
* highly available
* scalable

=== BOE
*Ask Interviewer:* 

** What are DAU(Daily active users)? = 5 Million
** What is average Video Size? = 300 MB

==== Storage Estimates
* Assuming 10% of DAU upload 1 video/day.
* Videos uploaded in 1 day = 5x10^5^. Space needed = 5x10^5^ x 300M = 150x10^12^ = 150TB/day
* 5 years = 150 x 30 x 365 x 5 = 8x10^18^ = 8 Exa bytes

==== QPS(Queries/sec)
* DAU = 5 Million. 1 user watch 5 videos/day
* QPS = 25M/86400 = 250

==== Bandwidth Estimates


=== API_Design (Upload, Search, Play)
* link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/README.adoc#methods[HTTP Methods]
* *Upload API*
```c
URL: http://youtube.com:8080/v1/upload
POST /video/
Request: { "title": "video", "description": "video1", "file_url": "https://example.com/video.mp4" }

uploadVideo(api_dev_key, video_title, vide_description, tags[], category_id, default_language, 
                        recording_details, video_contents)
Parameters:                        
api_dev_key (string): The API developer key of a registered account. This will be used to, among other things, throttle users based on their allocated quota.
video_title (string): Title of the video.
vide_description (string): Optional description of the video.
tags (string[]): Optional tags for the video.
category_id (string): Category of the video, e.g., Film, Song, People, etc.
default_language (string): For example English, Mandarin, Hindi, etc.
recording_details (string): Location where the video was recorded.
video_contents (stream): Video to be uploaded.                

Returns: (string)
- A successful upload will return HTTP 202 (request accepted)
- once the video encoding is completed the user is notified by email with a link to access the video. 
```
* *Search Video*
```c
URL: http://youtube.com:8080/v1/upload
GET /videos/{video_id}

searchVideo(api_dev_key, search_query, user_location, maximum_videos_to_return, page_token)
Parameters:
api_dev_key (string): The API developer key of a registered account of our service.
search_query (string): A string containing the search terms.
user_location (string): Optional location of the user performing the search.
maximum_videos_to_return (number): Maximum number of results returned in one request.
page_token (string): This token will specify a page in the result set that should be returned.

Returns(JSON)
A JSON containing information about the list of video resources matching the search query. 
Each video resource will have a video title, a thumbnail, a video creation date, and a view count.
```
* *Play video:* Done using embedded player on phone or browser. Rather application calls player APIs and player calls youtube
```c
URL: http://youtube.com:8080/v1/upload
GET /videos/{video_id}

streamVideo(api_dev_key, video_id, offset, codec, resolution)
api_dev_key (string): The API developer key of a registered account of our service.
video_id (string): A string to identify the video.
offset (number): We should be able to stream video from any offset; this offset would be a time in seconds from the beginning of the video.
codec (string) & resolution(string): We should send the codec and resolution info in the API from the client to support play/pause from multiple devices. Imagine you are watching a video on your TV’s Netflix app, paused it, and started watching it on your phone’s Netflix app. In this case, you would need codec and resolution, as both these devices have a different resolution and use a different codec.

Returns: (STREAM)
A media stream (a video chunk) from the given offset.
```

=== HLD
==== Uploading Video
* *Thumbnails:* Each video can have thumbnails of other videos. we can assume each video will have 5 other thumbnails.
* Metadata of video:
```c
  - title
  - file path in the system
  - uploading user
  - total views
  - likes, dislikes
```

```c
- **HOW VIDEOS ARE STORED?**
  - Store videos on multiple DB backends using sharding.
    1. [Approach-1, Wll not follow] Sharding based on userId's
        - userID > |Hash Func| > hash-value(maps to a DB)
        - `[Drawback]` if some user becomes hugely popular, then only 1 server will be loaded while others are free.
    2. [Approach-2, Wll not follow] Sharding based on Video's ID
        - Each video has a videoID
        - videoID > |Hash Func| > hash-value(maps to a DB)
        - `[Drawback]` if some video becomes most popular, this will overload few servers.
    3. [Appraoch-3] Consistent Hashing (will follow)
        - CH is used to balance load among servers.
- Less popular videos (1-20 views per day) that are not cached by CDNs can be served by our servers in various data centers.      
```
==== Playing_Video
```c
  user        
    -videoID->  CDN                     [Cache]==[App-server]         <<<DB-servers>>       
            video not here                      |                         |
                  --videoID--> |Hash-fun|-> Hash-value  ----Hash value--> |
                                                |                         |
                                                |                       hash found at server1,server3..
                                                | <-Ranked List of Videos-|
        <---------ranked video list-------------|
```
      
- **DETECTING DUPLICATE VIDEOS**
  - At time of uploading the videos, a service can run video matching algorithms (e.g., Block Matching, Phase Correlation, etc.) to find duplications.

=== DB_Schema
==== 5.1 Video_Metadata_DB
- MySQL DB
```c
- ***Table for each video***
| VideoID | Title | Description | Size | thumbnail | Uploader | No of Likes | Dislikes | Views |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- ***Table for each video comment***
| CommentID | VideoID | UserID | Comment | TimeOfCreation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- ***User table, storing user information***
| UserID | Name | email | Age| Registration detials |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

=== Load_Balancing
- Load between cache servers is balanced using link:/System-Design/Concepts/Hashing/Consistent_Hashing.md[Consistent Hashing]

=== Cache
- memcached in front of 'App-servers'.
- Cache Eviction Policy: LRU. Discard least recently viewed contents from cache.
